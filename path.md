## âš¡ **Study Tips for Each Module**

1. **Don't skip ahead** - Each concept builds on previous ones
2. **Practice daily** - Consistency beats intensity
3. **Understand, don't memorize** - Focus on concepts, not syntax
4. **Test edge cases** - What happens with NULLs, empty sets, duplicates?
5. **Optimize from the start** - Always consider performance
6. **Use real data** - Practice with meaningful datasets
7. **Explain your solutions** - If you can't explain it, you don't understand it

Happy learning! Each module should take 1-2 weeks to master before moving forward. ðŸš€
